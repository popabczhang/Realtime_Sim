# Realtime_Sim
An extenstion of the [CityMatrix](https://github.com/popabczhang/CityMatrix) project that adds realtime editable building properties (such as size and population) as well as data simulations (such as population density, and solar radiation).

An interactive display that lets users build mock cities from modular lego pieces. A webcam observes where each piece is placed and a projector displays informational overlays such as park access, parking access, and more. Allows for swift architectural prototyping. Each building piece can be customized to better fit a true hypothetical city. 

Closely related with [CityMatrix](https://github.com/popabczhang/CityMatrix) and [CityMatrixAR](https://github.com/popabczhang/CityMatrixAR).

A part of the [CityScope](http://cp.media.mit.edu/spatial-planning-platforms/) project at the MIT Media Lab: [Changing Places](http://cp.media.mit.edu/).
