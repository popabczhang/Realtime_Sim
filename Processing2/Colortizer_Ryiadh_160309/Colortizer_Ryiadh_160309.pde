// REPORT ALL CHANGES WITH DATE AND USER IN THIS AREA:
// - March 3, 2015: Edited "scanExport" Tab to include addional column of information for rotation
// - March 3, 2015: Edited "scanGrid" Tab to have buffer condition to reduce noise of pattern reading
// - March 5, 2015: Added "UMIClient" Tab to allow TCP connection to Rhino server. Also added method calls in "Colortizer" tabl and "scan" tab
// - March 6, 2015: Coded Keys '1,' '2,' '3,' '4,' and '5' to correspond with Rhino/SDL functions in "UMIClient" tab
// - March 6, 2015: Coded '6' key to restart server connection to Rhino
// - March 14, 2015: Allowed functionalities in keys 1-6 to also be received via UDP (i.e. from Legotizer)
// - August 4, 2015: IW - Deprecated "UMIClient" Tab (formerly "gameClient" Tab)
// - August 4, 2015: IW - Add 8 More Tag Definitions, for a total of 24.
// - August 5, 2015: IW - Made Extra Tag Definitions easy to turn on/off (i.e. constrain to 8, 16 or 24 IDs only)
// - August 5, 2015: IW - Can save/load number of tag definitions to use, and displays state at bottom of screen
// - August 16, 2015:IW - Added UI for locking click-and-drag Grid edits and for turning UMI client on/off 
/*

SETUP:
Step 0: configure "int camera" to be associated with your camera and resolution of choice.  Use "Capture.list()" to explore cameras available in processing.
Step 1: Decide how many unique, distorted planes you need to scan.
Step 2: Decide how many uniqe grids of information needed for each plane
Step 3: Alter "int[] numGridAreas" accordingly
Step 4: Alter "scanExport" tab to relevant port on destination machine [i.e. udp.send( dataToSend, "localhost", 6152]
Step 5: Run application

// Change this number to change which Area is scanned (i.e. 0, 1, or 2)
int imageIndex = 0; //Selection of scanImage to start

//Number of scan grids to be created on each warped image
// For example:
// {1,1,1,1} creates 4 scan grids, each on their own, separately programmed, distorted image
// {4} creates 4 scan grids, all sharing the same distorted image
// Max Spec: {20,20,20,20,20,20,20,20,20,20} <-- will probably run terribly, though
